						<p><p>In order to cope with rapidity with which knowledge itself changes, today&rsquo;s students must seek to achieve academic excellence. Though education is the most powerful weapon, which you can use to change the world our girls in Loreto know that academic excellence is not just achieving good grades or superior performance but its maximum development of one&rsquo;s intellectual capacities and skills in service to humanity.<br />With this in mind Loreto High School steps up to impact our society by impacting the girl&rsquo;s status of mind, body and spirit. Consequently giants, heroes, doctors, lawyers, architects and teachers have been borne from this esteemed school.Loreto High School is an example of the mustard seed that is so small yet brings forth a great tree. The input of all stakeholders: sponsors, teachers, parents and students is what takes us to the peak academically.<br />Haxley said: Everyman who knows how to read has it in his power to magnify himself, to multiply the ways in which he exists, to make his life full, significant and interesting&rdquo;&nbsp; This is our great calling towards our girls.<br />May God make the girls future worthy of dreams.<br />God bless Loreto High School.</p></p>

						<p><p>Every parent with a girl child dreams of joining Loreto High School Limuru because of the values instilled at the institution. Our core values; justice, sincerity, joy and truth, which are the pillars on which women of integrity emanate. A well rounded person is positively productive in the society and leaves a lasting impact wherever she goes.<br />It is, therefore, our endeavour as the Loreto fraternity, to work in unity, love and peace to take the institution to greater heights of achievement. Listening, following instructions as well as cooperating with others ensures that the Loreto girl leaves the institution well prepared to face the challenging world.<br />The springboard to our excellence in performance has been self-discipline. The young women in our Loreto home know that to compete with the world, knowledge is of essence. It is knowledge that gives power, while discipline defines the character of an individual. As such, all &lsquo;Kotetians&rsquo; agree that intelligence well wrapped with character, is what true education is all about.<br />Young people have inborn talents that are well brought out in high school. Loreto high school has an environment where great talent is discovered and actualize.

						<p><p>Loreto Limuru opened its doors in 1936 with seven girls. With time, it has grown from a one stream school to six streams in form one and five streams in forms two, three and four. The school is shy of 1200 students who are housed in ten dormitories. Among the dormitories, there still stand two of them that reminds us of 1936; Haiti, and Rusinga. Each dormitory has a dorm mistress to oversee the welfare of the students.<br />Being a national school, we receive students from all over the country and the boarding team ensures that the girls live in harmony and cohesion. The dormitories were named after famous islands. Plans are underway to name them after its founders. We thank the entire Loreto Limuru parents&rsquo; body for providing their daughters with personal effects so as to make their stay in school comfortable.<br />God bless Loreto Limuru.</p></p>
